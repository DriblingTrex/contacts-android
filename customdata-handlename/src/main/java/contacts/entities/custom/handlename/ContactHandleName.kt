// Dev note: The functions that return a List instead of a Sequence are useful for Java consumers
// as they will not have to convert Sequences to List. Also, all are functions instead of properties
// with getters because there are some setters that have to be functions. So all are functions
// to keep uniformity for OCD purposes.

// Another dev note: Receiver signatures are the concrete types instead of the interface type.
// This is done so that consumers gets references to actual concrete types, which may implement
// other interfaces required by APIs in this library.
